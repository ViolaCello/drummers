This is the Drummers Practice App, that will help you to stay on a practice regimen to track you progress of each practice lesson and update it with your current/latest BMP (beats per minute)/tempo.

You, the Drummer (ie., User) will be able to:
    1) Create an account (Sign Up)
    2) Log in
    3) Log out when finished
    4) Create a public profile page
    5) Choose from an existing list of practice lessons to enter what BPM you were able to get up to today
    6) Create a new lesson that will be publicly available to other Drummers (Users)
    7) View other Drummers profile pages
    8) Edit your own Profile Page
    9) Look at the Leaders Board Page, which shows which Drummer in our community is practice each of the lessons at the highest tempo.
